# STAT 350 Final Project - Used Car Datasets from Cardekho
This project uses a dataset coming from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/nehalbirla/vehicle-dataset-from-cardekho) that contains used cars listed on www.cardekho.com.
The objective of this project is to identify relationships between variables, and build a regression model of price prediction for used car.

# Summary of The Project
In this project, we investigate the relationship between several factors and selling price of cars. We build multiple linear regression models and conduct ANOVA test on selected certain models to obatain specific linear relationships between vehicle selling price and certain explanatory variables. Beside the investigation of linear relationships, we also construct a function which can perform relative accurate prediction on the selling price of a vehicle given several explanatory variables. Then we ran a test to test the accuracy of the prediciton by dividing the observation into two parts and building the function based on the first part, then test it on another one.
